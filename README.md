# ðŸŽ„Advent of Code 2024 ðŸŽ„

Welcome to my solutions for the Advent of Code 2024! This repository contains my attempts
to tackle the daily programming puzzles released during December. Each day brings a new
challenge, and Iâ€™ll be solving them in Kotlin.

## About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024) is an annual set of programming puzzles
that are published daily from December 1st to 25th. The puzzles are a fun way to:

- Practice and enhance your programming skills
- Solve real-world-inspired challenges
- Compete with others or just have fun solving at your own pace

## Repository Structure

Each puzzle is organized by day, with the solution for the first day already implemented.

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ main/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ kotlin/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ com/
